## About me
I received my M.S. degree and B.S degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering (CSIE) from the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (TaiwanTech), Taipei, Taiwan. Since 2020, I have started to study end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) and and visual question answering (VQA). My research interests are multi-modal representation learning, and Natural Language Processing(NLP).
