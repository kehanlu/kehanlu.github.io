## About me

I received my M.S. degree and B.S degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering (CSIE) from the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (TaiwanTech), Taiwan, under the supervision of Prof. [Kuan-Yu Chen](https://faculty.csie.ntust.edu.tw/~kychen/). Starting from June 2023, I've been serve as a research assistant at the Speech Processing and Machine Learning Lab, National Taiwan University, advised by Prof. [Hung-Yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php).

My research interests are multi-modal representation learning, speech processing, and Natural Language Processing(NLP).
